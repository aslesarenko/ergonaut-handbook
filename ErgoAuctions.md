## Step 1

Open [ergoUtils](https://ergoutils.org/) and [ergoauctions.org](http://ergoauctions.org) at the same time. Start filling in the Artwork NFT details, upload the file and select `Upload Artwork` - once you've done this, fill in your auction listing, and hit `Create Auction`

## Step 2

This will give you an address to send to, selected `Advanced Configuration` on ErgoUtils, and copy and paste the values into the text-areas. Once you hit `Issue` your coin and `NFT` will be transferred, and your auctioned started.
