Ergo builds advanced cryptographic features and radically new DeFi functionality on the rock-solid foundations laid by a decade of blockchain theory and development. It complements tried and tested principles with the latest peer-reviewed academic research into cryptography, consensus models and digital currencies.

Ergo is a unique Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency and DeFi platform, building on the first principles of Bitcoin. With a research-driven but practical development model, Ergo has prioritized useful features without compromising on security. The platform's smart contracts are built on the extended UTXO (eUTXO) model with a unique data input concept, offering a radically different approach to provide robust, flexible cryptography and easy, safe scripting on privacy-centric Sigma Protocols (non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs). Storage rent for long-term survivability, ultra-efficient light clients, and NiPoPoW technology for interoperability.

Check the next pin up for our Roadmap

The main objective of Ergo is to provide financial contracts efficiently and securely so that people can use them in a decentralised manner and without any need for prior trust. The fully Cardano-compatible PoW can make significant contributions to all developers in the eUTxO ecosystem.
