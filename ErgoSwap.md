ETA: Q3 2021 ErgoDex support added in yoroi wallet

ErgoSwap is a Uniswap-like AMM-based Decentralised Exchange (DEX). DEXs are a type of cryptocurrency exchange which allows for direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions, reducing the need for centralised exchanges.

In ErgoSwap anyone can discover the match for orders and then submit the swap transaction and get incentive including offchain services, it shows more or less approach of Ergo and concepts of earning without mining rig with Ergo dapps while promoting decentralization and privacy at the same time

Atomic exchange for tokens on top of Ergo is implemented in the core, so yes, everything will be DEX and there will be lots of DEXes, matchers also possible
