# Where can I buy Erg?

The leading exchanges are currently CoinEx, Hotbit and Bitmart.

# Where can I store Erg?

Yoroi is the most popular choice, you can also run a full node or use Coinbarn. more information on [ergoplatform.org](https://ergoplatform.org/en/wallets/)

## Is there mobile support?

Soon! There is an iOS app near completion by a community member, and Yoroi Mobile integration is also being worked on.

## Can we use a hardware wallet?

Not yet, Ledger support underway. 

# Why PoW ?

Proof-of-Work has tried and tested methods, and provides several benefits over PoS. You can see Charles Hoskinson discussing some of those benefits in a [recent AMA (timestamped)](https://youtu.be/Y27Q3wL_Hko?t=207)

## Can I mine Erg?

You will need a dedicated GPU (AMD/Intel), see [Mining](/Mining)

# What uses will Ergo have?

DEx, StableCoin, bringing PoW benefits to Cardano, Oracle Pools, and much more !

# Oracle Pools? Like Chainlink?
There's a solid comparison of Oracle Pools on Ergo vs Chainlink givenon the [ergoforum](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/oracle-pools-a-new-oracle-model/263) (by Robert Kornacki, Head of Research @ Emurgo)

# What is the Ergo Foundation? 

The Ergo Foundation is a community-driven entity focused on:
1. Promoting non-breaking development of Ergo Platform protocol;
1. Promoting the widespread adoption and use of Ergo Platform and its native token (ERG);
1. Developing the ecosystem around the Ergo Platform;
1. Promoting the use of Ergo Platform and blockchain technology for social good;
1. Supporting truly decentralized infrastructure, and;
1. Supporting privacy as a basic human right.

The Treasury’s allocation of Ergs is equivalent to 10% of the total block reward over the first 2 years and leaves miners with a block reward of 67.5 Ergs per block. After 2 years, the Treasury will continue to receive the part of the block reward that exceeds 67.5 Erg, however, this will be 0 after year 2.5 when the block reward becomes 66 Ergs per block

## Why 'Ergo'? 

“Ergo means “therefore” in Latin, but “work” in Greek. I prefer the second meaning, but both are fine. Initially the name was chosen to point to the fact that the design of the cryptocurrency is ERGOnomical.”

# What are the basics?

The cryptographic part of Ergo script is based on sigma protocols and naturally supports threshold m-of-n signatures, ring signatures and more. Keeping all this in mind, we expect ErgoScript and Ergo’s design to make it uniquely useful as Contractual Money with countless applications possible. Ergo DApps and offchain protocols may be implemented in a truly decentralized way due to light clients.

For more fundamental changes Ergo is following a soft-forkability approach --- if an overwhelming majority of the network accepts a new feature, it is activated, however, old nodes which do not upgrade continue to operate normally and just skip over this feature validation. Thus disruptive hard forks should not be required in Ergo.

Ergo mining will always be stable, unlike Bitcoin and other PoW currencies, in which mining may become unstable after the emission period. Second, state size growth becomes controllable and predictable reducing hardware requirements for Ergo miners. Third, by collecting storage fees from outdated boxes, miners return lost coins to circulation preventing a steady decrease of circulating supply due to lost keys. To achieve survivability, Ergo provides economic improvements in addition to the technical ones, most central of which is a storage fee component which plays an important role for Ergo‘s stability.

All cryptocurrencies rely on contributions from the scientific research community. Gladly Ergo brings it in the core! 

# Why was non-outsourceability turned off?

Robert K, discusses this [here (14:45)](https://youtu.be/2sbTMrQwWOw)

With smart contracts it's basically impossible to prevent pools, so they turned it off so that not only larger players were able to take advantage of the loophole. Ergo is now focusing on memory hardness in attempt to keep mining as fair as possible, which should help prevent ASICs mining at least.
