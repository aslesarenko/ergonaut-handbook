{.is-info}


ErgoMixer is a web application for mixing ergs and tokens based on Ergo platform. ErgoMixer is a completely serverless, Non-interactive and non-custodial mixer; It only needs to connect to the explorer and a node (any node! no api_key is needed).

The mixer only mixes while the application is running - however, you can close to pause mixing at any time, covert addresses will also work fine and start mixing when you launch the application.
