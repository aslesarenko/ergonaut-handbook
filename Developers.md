# ErgoScript
Learn [Ergoscript by reading example smart contracts](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example) powered by the Ergo Playground.

Each contract example includes a `Ergo Playground` link which allows you to instantly edit and run the smart contract code inside of your browser.

If you ever need clarity about how specific types/functions/operators in ErgoScript work, please reference the [ErgoScript Language Description](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/docs/LangSpec.md).
