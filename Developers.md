# Proposed Nautilus ZK Treasury

This basic concept is to create a visual programming toolkit to assist developers in learning and developing contracts in the EUTXO model. 

This toolkit will initially be built on top of Ergo Playground.  

The goal is to take advantage of the free composability offered by EUTXO. Create an open source library of visual, composable tools to onboard new developers. 

The “long term” goal is to create a headless central management system for developers, and a front-end UI focused central management system for basic users that are both interoperable with this visual programming toolkit. 

The name Nautilus is inspired by the Submarine in Jules Verne 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Nautilus is described by Verne as "a masterpiece containing masterpieces", which was built in secrecy, sourcing parts from unnamed sources and roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments.

# ErgoScript
Learn [Ergoscript by reading example smart contracts](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example) powered by the Ergo Playground.

Each contract example includes a `Ergo Playground` link which allows you to instantly edit and run the smart contract code inside of your browser.

If you ever need clarity about how specific types/functions/operators in ErgoScript work, please reference the [ErgoScript Language Description](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/docs/LangSpec.md).
