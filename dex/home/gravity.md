We are excited to announce Waves’ new partnership agreement with the Ergo Foundation. The agreement stipulates integration of Ergo as a Gravity target chain, as well as collaborative R&D on cross-chain solutions with a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized oracles.

One of the first collaborative tasks will be integration of the Ergo blockchain into the Gravity blockchain-agnostic network, with the creation of cross-chain gateways between the Ergo blockchain and other Gravity target chains.


“So far, the concepts implemented in Ergo seem complex, multi-layered algebraic abstractions and are somewhat difficult for developers to grasp,” says Aleksei Pupyshev, Waves Tech evangelist and author of Gravity. “However, it’s precisely this radically new perspective that helps create innovative protocols and might be essential in solving problems in decentralized systems and improving them, be that architecture of a blockchain network or a network of oracles.”

“Integration with Gravity is more than an interesting technical challenge,” adds Alexander Chepurnoy, Ergo core developer. “It offers an opportunity to open the Ergo blockchain to a large number of digital assets from the blockchain networks integrated with Gravity, which will create a stable foundation for the development of DeFi on Ergo.”

### TRON

Together, Waves and TRON are using Gravity to connect their respective blockchains' smart contract languages: Ride and Solidity. Gravity is a blockchain and token-agnostic oracle with a cross-chain communication network. TRON and Waves are establishing a bridge through Gravity which will allow both ecosystems to enhance access to services for two userbases. 
 
 
- $TRX, $BTT, $JST and other TRC-20 tokens such as $TRON-USDT will be available on the Waves blockchain via seamless decentralized gateways (Gravity swap) and automatically listed on Waves' DEXes (like waves.exchange), meaning that users and developers from the Waves ecosystem will be able to trade, hold and use TRC-20 tokens.
- Conversely, $WAVES, $USDN, $NSBT, $WEST and other tokens of the Waves ecosystem will be available on the TRON blockchain via Gravity and automatically listed on TRON's DEXes and DeFi services (like TronTrade or PoloniDex), meaning that users and developers from the TRON ecosystem will be able to trade, hold, and use Waves-based tokens.
- TRON and Waves’ decentralized application (dApp) developers will be able to use data feed services of Gravity oracles.
- Seamless $TRON-USDT <-> $USDN swaps services will be introduced. Such applications will allow users to manage various strategies for holding stablecoins, including $USDT on the TRON blockchain as the fastest and cheapest way to transfer stablecoins and $USDN as a staking stablecoin.
- Developers from both ecosystems will be able to create modern cross-chain dApps which will work in both chains (capable of being expanded to other chains via Gravity) via wallets and browser extensions preferred by users.
