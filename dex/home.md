Dexentralised Exchanges or *DEXes* - allow peer to peer trading without a central authority. - The [SigmaUSD](/SigmaUSD) (instantiation of AgeUSD) is technically also a decentralised exchange, however [ErgoDex](/ergodex) is closer to what most people recognise as a decentralised exchange today.

Additionally integration with [Gravity/Waves](gravity) is nearing completion, and a Trustless  [Local Exchange Trading System (LETS)](/dex/Local-Exchange-Trading-System) is possible ontop Ergo.
