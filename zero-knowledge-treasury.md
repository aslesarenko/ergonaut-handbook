# Proposed Ergo Auction ZK Treasury
There is currently a proposal for Ergo Auction to develop a ZK Treasury to attract new artists and musicians to contribute content. 

The hope is by potentially covering auction listing fees, new artists can be onboarded, and educate their fans/followers. This ideally sets up a pathway for long term growth. 


# Proposed Nautilus ZK Treasury

This basic concept is to create a visual programming toolkit to assist developers in learning and developing contracts in the EUTXO model. 

This toolkit will initially be built on top of Ergo Playground.  

The goal is to take advantage of the free composability offered by EUTXO. Create an open source library of visual, composable tools to onboard new developers. 

The “long term” goal is to create a headless central management system for developers, and a front-end UI focused central management system for basic users that are both interoperable with this visual programming toolkit. 

The name Nautilus is inspired by the Submarine in Jules Verne 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Nautilus is described by Verne as "a masterpiece containing masterpieces", which was built in secrecy, sourcing parts from unnamed sources and roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments.
